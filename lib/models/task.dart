class Task {
  final String title;        // The title of the task, which is a required string
  final bool isCompleted;    // A boolean indicating whether the task is completed or not

  Task({required this.title, required this.isCompleted});
// Constructor for Task class, which takes two required parameters:
// - title: Represents the title of the task, which must be provided when creating an instance of Task.
// - isCompleted: Represents whether the task is completed or not, also required when creating an instance.

// There are no additional methods or logic provided in this class,
// as it's a straightforward representation of a task with its title and completion status.
